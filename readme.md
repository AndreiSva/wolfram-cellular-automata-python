# Wolframs Cellular Automata in Python

Wolfram's Cellular Automata is a form of 1 dimensional cellular automata in which all possible rules are encoded into one byte as described here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html

This is an implementation of this system in Python.


First clone the git by using

```
git clone https://liamilan@bitbucket.org/liamilan/wolfram-cellular-automata-python.git
```

Then run the program in the directory using


```
python wolfram.py 18
```
or:

```
python wolfram.py {any number between 0 and 255}
```
